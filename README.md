# BibtexCleaner
Simple Python script to remove unwanted stuff from a bibtex file.

## How to use
Make sure you have the required packages and python 3 environment to run the script.

Add your .bib file into the same directory as bibtex_cleaner.py and ensure the references_file variable has the same name so the script knows what file to read.

Set the tags you want removing from the bib file in the unwanted_tags array and set the output_file name you want then run the program.
